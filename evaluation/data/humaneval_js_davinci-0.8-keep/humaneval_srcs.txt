You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions. The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName. If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should choose the one that comes first in the list. For example, if you are given "Slices" as the class and a list of the extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension (its strength is -1).

Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence. Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence: tri(1) = 3 tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even. tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.

Your task is to determine if it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the following operation on the given array: You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times. One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation then return True else return False. If the given array is empty then return True.

I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are definitely worth noting down and comparing. Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches. You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly, the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.

Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence. The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1. Note: 1. Collatz(1) is [1]. 2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

You are given a list of two strings, both strings consist of open parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')' only. Your job is to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in some order, that the resulting string will be good. A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S are balanced. For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string '())' is not. Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.

Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line. n cars are driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars are said to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. This function outputs the number of such collisions.

Two cars are said to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. This function outputs the number of such collisions.

It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading. The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading. She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table: GPA | Letter grade 4.0 A+ > 3.7 A > 3.3 A- > 3.0 B+ > 2.7 B > 2.3 B- > 2.0 C+ > 1.7 C > 1.3 C- > 1.0 D+ > 0.7 D > 0.0 D- 0.0 E

Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N] inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid. You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells, in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current cell. Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not necessarily distinct). You CANNOT go off the grid. A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k) such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have lst_A[j] = lst_B[j]. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique. Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

You can start from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells, in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current cell. Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not necessarily distinct). You CANNOT go off the grid. A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k) such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have lst_A[j] = lst_B[j]. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique. Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.
